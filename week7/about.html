    Chef Hans Dannerhoj cooks with serious passion. Born and Raised in Brooklyn, New York and brought up from Italian and Danish decent. He comes from a long line of amazing cooks. On one side, his Danish grandmother, a classic trained chef born in Denmark, brought to life a young boy in love with food. On the other side, his Italian grandmother brought the delicious flavors of Italian cuisine to their house every Sunday with her traditional Italian family fare. And then thereâ€™s his parents, who themselves can satisfy the ever indulging palette of any individual who loves home cooked meals. At a very young age of recollection he remembers his father putting him up on a stepstool and teaching him how to make the perfect egg. From there it took off with his mothers tantalizing dinners that would come at inexpensive fare. So growing up in a mostly Italian family you can understand food was the number one priority.
