        A self taught chef with inspirations literally stemming from his soul, and love of multiple cuisines, Hans made it his mission to experience every flavor imaginable.  He started his culinary adventure at one of the hottest Mexican fare restaurants in Brooklyn, Alma. He traveled to Mexico in order to experience the authentic, local food, first hand, and incorporated those flavors into his menus.  Alma was named one of the best rooftops in the world by Conde Nast. Hans also appeared on the History Channel, being noted for one of the best chefs creating “must have” food in NY for Cinco de Mayo.  A quote from Eats.com magazine, says it best… “If cooking was a band, Hans Dannerhoj would be the Phil Collins of Mexican food”.
